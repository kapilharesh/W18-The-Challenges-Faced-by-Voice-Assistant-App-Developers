# The Challenges Faced by Voice Assistant App Developers.

## Abstract
Inspired by the findings of Murphy-Hill, Zimmermann, and Nagappan in the paper [_Cowboys, ankle sprains, and keepers of quality: How is video game development different from software development_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/murphyhill-icse-2014.pdf) and Joorabchi, Mesbah, and Kruchten in  [Real Challenges in Mobile App Development](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6681334/), we investigated the challenges faced by voice assistant (VA) application (app) developers. In contrast to the above mentioned papers who conducted interviews and surveys, we mined StackOverflow for posts related to Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa to retrieve qualitative data on developer issues. Our study examines how these posts fall into the Knowledge Areas described in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Our results indicate that there are issues common to both Software Design and Construction of VA apps. The number of issues faced or posts created varies monthly, but is seen to rise overall with respect to Google Assistant and Alexa. An optimization of sandboxed "slot'' implementation and improved integration of multiple APIs and platforms such as Google Assistant APIs, AWS services and Raspberry Pis can be achieved through cogent documentation.
