abstract="Programming question and answer (Q{\&}A) websites, such as Stack Overflow, leverage the knowledge and expertise of users to provide answers to technical questions. Over time, these websites turn into repositories of software engineering knowledge. Such knowledge repositories can be invaluable for gaining insight into the use of specific technologies and the trends of developer discussions. Previous work has focused on analyzing the user activities or the social interactions in Q{\&}A websites. However, analyzing the actual textual content of these websites can help the software engineering community to better understand the thoughts and needs of developers. In the article, we present a methodology to analyze the textual content of Stack Overflow discussions. We use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a statistical topic modeling technique, to automatically discover the main topics present in developer discussions. We analyze these discovered topics, as well as their relationships and trends over time, to gain insights into the development community. Our analysis allows us to make a number of interesting observations, including: the topics of interest to developers range widely from jobs to version control systems to C{\#} syntax; questions in some topics lead to discussions in other topics; and the topics gaining the most popularity over time are web development (especially jQuery), mobile applications (especially Android), Git, and MySQL.",

pages="245--259",
abstract="With the rapid adoption of REpresentational State Transfer(REST), more software organizations expose their applications as RESTful web APIs and client code developers integrate RESTful APIs into their applications. When web APIs evolve, the client code developers have to update their applications to incorporate the API changes accordingly. However client code developers often encounter challenges during the migration and API providers have little knowledge of how client code developers react to the API changes. In this paper, we investigate the changes among subsequent versions of APIs and classify the identified changes to understand how the RESTful web APIs evolve. We study the on-line discussion from developers to the API changes by analyzing the StackOverflow questions. Through an empirical study, we identify 21 change types and 7 of them are new compared with existing studies. We find that a larger portion of RESTful web API elements are changed between versions compared with Java APIs and WSDL services. Moreover, our results show that adding new methods in the new version causes more questions and views from developers. However the deleted methods draw more relevant discussions. In general, our results provide valuable insights of RESTful web API evolution and help service providers understand how their consumers react to the API changes in order to improve the practice of evolving the service APIs.",
